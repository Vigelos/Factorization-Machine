# Factorization-Machine
An implenmentation of the model Factorization machine(FM) in matlab.
<br><br>

Factorization Machine(FM) (Steffen Rendle) is an effective way to learn paramaters from sprase data, and there are already many well-implenmented model written in **python**. If you want to learn about the detail of the model, it is recommended to also try those models. <br>
<br>
This model is an implenmentation of FM **written totally in matlab** and you can just simply download all the files to the same folder and run **FactorizationMachine.mlx** in matlab to use this model. Have fun with this model :)

<br>

**How to use all these files:ðŸ‘‡**<br><br>


> `FactorizationMachine.mlx`: **The main function of all these files, including data precessing, model training and result evaluation. RUN this file to use this model**
>
> `FM.m`: The class of FM model, which has propertise of w0, wi and v; functions of construct function, predict result from input and model training.
>
> `ratings.csv`: The data set used for this model, [User,Item,Rating,Timestemp], comes from movieLens small. 
>
> `result.bmp`: A brief result given by the model.
